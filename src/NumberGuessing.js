/*
    Since you'll be starting a game from multiple places (initial mounting, and clicking NEW GAME), 
    your constructor function should assign an empty object to this.state. You should have a method 
    called _startGame that will use this.setState to reset the game. It will set the gameStatus to playing, 
    the numberToGuess using Math.random, and the guesses to an empty array.
    
    In the render method, if this.state.gameStatus is not defined, simply return null.
    
    The next thing you'll want to do is start a new game when the component gets mounted in the DOM. 
    There happens to be a method that you can implement in your component that will be called exactly 
    as soon as the component gets mounted: componentDidMount. If you add this method to your component, 
    React will call it right after your component is displayed on the screen. 
    In this method, you can call this._startGame() to make this happen. 
    This will in turn call setState, which will re-render your component. 
    At that point the game will start :)
